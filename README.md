The project virtualpet-shelter-amok is a program that keeps track of mutiple classed pets within a colleciton/map.  With user input you can feed and water the organic pets, and the robotic pets you can oil so that they are well maintained.  Another option within the menu is to admit and new pet that you have come across or even have a current pet be adopted out of the shelter.  If the pets health reaches zero they will be considered dead and removed from the collection/map.  This is a more advanced version of our last project the virtualpet-shelter.
