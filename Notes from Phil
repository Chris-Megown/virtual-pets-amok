Notes from Phil Elauria

- No college, minimum wage then to sales (10 yrs)
- Worked in a newspaper found the bootcamp ad there
- After a year of coding applyied out, hit big with Microsoft.
- Interviews through bootcamp out west, him appying to the right people at the right time.  Knew a person that knew a guy etc.
- Coding puzzle website that you get ranked and had recruiters watching got him an interview at Google.
- Hack Reactor
- Library project posts to: it was shared on GirHub still uses GitHub. Once people were sharing it we started posting it on social media to keep the buzz going and get more hits.**
- Still talks to people from cohort, continue those relationships.
- API? Watson AI
- Applicaiton Programming Interface is a set of subroutine defnitions, protocols and tools for building application sotware. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of comms between various software components.**
- You have to constantly teach yourself, always serchign for stuff to learn.
- Focus on things that are relavent to what you want to do now and what to do next.
- Didn't know any Ruby and that is waht they used at his first job.
- "People will ask you to do stuff and you will ahve to figure it out."
- Playing with code and breaking things. Javascript to Ruby was easier than Java.
- Referencing the code bank in something you're doing you can use it to figure out what you have to do next or when you're stuck.
- Getting familiar with the code base you're going to be working with.  Senior members of his work were very generous with fresh developers.  
- Legacy Code?
- Everybody uses Google to find answers!! 
- New contexts new ways to do things and Google is great to use for that
- uses a Mac in Silicon Valley, most of the Microsoft business out there are start ups bought by Microsoft. 
- Everybody from senior to fresh; don't want to look stupid, their educaion doesn't play a huge role in their job, stackoverflow and reading online is their key point, "it's all about self study".
-Pair Programming out there? Uses Yammer, depends on team, they do standups.
Questions are in ( )

-( I would like to know, in his experience, what are some of the real world challenges he faces in the workforce that his bootcamp didn't prepare him for.)
- The quicker you can get over yourself and jsut focus on your thing and learn. It's hard but worrying about yourself not letting the guy next to you typing bother you.

-(What is Microsoft's culture like?)
-Booze in he fridge, brings his dog to work, very friendly. Pretty nice 

(Do u feel like Muay Thai help balance your mental workout going through the bootcamp to help you relax and stay focused?)
- Always adapting, it's great when the coworkers understand that I want to go workout.  Used to be a personal trainer. 

 -(How did your previous experience differentiate you, or help you in your current role? Did your sales experience help you?)
 - People wanna work with people they like.

- (Being in the valley, what are some new languages or direction you see coming in IT?)
- Android implementing a new language, 5 years old, text editors for java. Kotlin?? moving from Java to Kotlin.  Says it makes things easier but it's very big.  No point of exception. Null value issues.

(is it overwhelming to have so much to learn? how are the hours and is work/life balance a struggle?)

- Find the company that respects the balance of work, learning, homelife. There is too much too learn. Cannot learn it all, think ahead on how you want to grow. Don't be reactive in learning. Plan ahead on what to learn so it follows to you end goal(s).
(how important (or not) has LinkedIN been for you and others?)

-Not that big, recruiters hit him up a lot but he doesn't worry about it as much. Went to meet ups, having too much to learn. Took out some of the meet ups. Focused on learning Ruby on Rails**.  Networking for a job, the meet ups are great for it. LinkedIn isn't bad. He's gotten people jobs that that hit him up on LinkedIn... so there's that. Either stategy works. Single best value are the people that know you in person that can talk you up later on.
(How do the part timers carry on)

- It's going to take time and work, develp those skills to get there.  Be competetive. If you do that you will have a job in developing.
(what about user groups? does the same hold true for user groups as for meetups are they about the same?)

- Rarely ever uses them, usually people ask very basic questions.  Things that you could Google for. 
(How many people buy into learning how to learn)

-That's exactly what the professionals do. Set goals and work towards them.  Very important. Don't follow the shiny things. Stop yourself and Focus. Dedicate time to learn things. Get comfortable asking questions, not konwing words.
- Be prepared to do the work that is needed. The industry needs people. The demand is absolutely there.
